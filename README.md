## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login`: User login and JWT token generation.
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user (Admin/Faculty/Student).
- `GET /api/auth/me`: Retrieve authenticated user details.

### Timetable Management

- `GET /api/timetable`: Fetch all timetables.
- `POST /api/timetable`: Create a new timetable (admin-only).
- `PUT /api/timetable/:id`: Update a specific timetable (admin-only).
- `DELETE /api/timetable/:id`: Delete a timetable (admin-only).

### Attendance Management

- `GET /api/attendance`: Get attendance records.
- `POST /api/attendance`: Mark attendance for a class.
- `PUT /api/attendance/:id`: Update attendance for a class.

## Validation and Security

- **Zod**: Ensures consistent and secure data validation across API endpoints.
- **JWT**: Securely manages authentication and authorization via JSON Web Tokens.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed and salted using `bcrypt` before storage in the database.
- **Role-Based Access**: API routes are protected by middleware that checks the user's role (Admin/Faculty/Student).

## Future Enhancements

- **iCal Integration**: Allow users to export their timetable to iCal format.
- **Push Notifications**: Integrate push notifications for real-time updates on schedule changes.
- **Attendance Analytics**: Provide faculty and admins with detailed analytics on student attendance.
